# SQL PROJECT

## Description

This project is a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data and Nashville housing information, showcasing two distinct aspects:

1. **Data Exportation Project - Covid 19:**
   - In this part, I collect and export data related to Covid-19, specifically focusing on mortality rates ("CovidDeaths") and vaccination statistics ("CovidVaccines"). The project aims to provide structured datasets that can be easily utilized for analysis and visualization.

2. **Data Cleaning Project - Nashville Housing:**
   - The second segment of the project focuses on data cleaning for Nashville housing information. The dataset ("Nashville Housing") is processed and refined to ensure accurate and reliable insights. This step is crucial for any subsequent analysis or machine learning applications involving the housing data.

The repository includes scripts, documentation, and examples to facilitate the understanding and utilization of the provided datasets. Whether you are interested in COVID-19 statistics or Nashville housing trends, this project provides a foundation for further exploration and analysis.



## Overview

This project encompasses two distinct data-related initiatives - a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 statistics and an in-depth analysis of Nashville housing data.

### Key Features:

1. **Data Exportation Project - Covid 19:**
   - Collects and exports data on Covid-19, specifically focusing on mortality rates ("CovidDeaths") and vaccination statistics ("CovidVaccines").
   - Aims to provide clean, structured datasets for further analysis and visualization.
       ### Files
        - `CovidDeaths`: This excel file contains data related to Covid-19 mortality rates. It includes information such as the number of deaths, date of occurrence, and possibly other relevant details. The dataset is curated for exportation, making it suitable for further analysis or visualization.
        - `CovidVaccines`: This excel file comprises data on Covid-19 vaccination statistics. It includes information about the number of vaccine doses administered, vaccination rates, and potentially additional relevant metrics. The dataset is prepared for exportation, facilitating easy integration into data-driven projects.
          
2. **Data Cleaning Project - Nashville Housing:**
   - Processes and refines the Nashville housing dataset ("Nashville Housing") to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   - Essential step for subsequent analysis or machine learning applications involving the housing data.
        ### Files
        - `Nashville Housing`: This Excel file is a comprehensive dataset that captures various aspects of the housing market in Nashville. It includes information on property listings, sales transactions, and key indicators influencing the real estate landscape. The dataset may encompass details such as property prices, square footage, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other relevant attributes.
       

### Why This Project?

- **Comprehensive COVID-19 Insights:**
  - Explore mortality rates and vaccination trends, contributing to a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

- **Nashville Housing Trends:**
  - Gain valuable insights into Nashville's housing market through cleaned and refined datasets.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for data enthusiasts, researchers, and analysts looking to delve into COVID-19 statistics and Nashville housing trends.
